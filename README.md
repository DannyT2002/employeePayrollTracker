# Employee Payroll Tracker
## Project Description

This website allows users to input employee data, including first name, last name, and salary, for multiple employees. Upon clicking the "Add Employees" button, users are prompted to enter the number of employees and then input data for each employee. The system then calculates and displays the average salary, selects and displays a random employee, and organizes and displays the employee data in an HTML table sorted by last name.
